[no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs)
==================================================================================
No matter what stance one has in the debate on tabs versus spaces, **mixing them is definitely bad**. That's all there is to that.

The `smart-tabs` option enables [SmartTabs](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs), which is a reasonable approach to alignment and indentation with good tool support.

For more details on `TABS VERSUS SPACES`â„¢ and the issues with mixing them, see [indent](indent.md).
