[semi-style](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi-style)
======================================================
Since semicolons should be used only where their removal would cause harm (see [semi](semi.md)), they should be located in a prominent place.

Locating them at the end of a line tends to make them go unnoticed. Located at the start of a line, they will usually be more likely to be noticed by the developer.
