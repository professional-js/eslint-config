========================================================================================
Spacing helps distinguishing the members.
Other than slightly larger files, I can see no downside to that. And the size increase is not an issue:
1.	File size differences of a few characters in source files are just inconsequential, given today's storage devices.
2.	Transpilation does unspeakable things to whitespace, so it's fully irrelevant for deployment files.
