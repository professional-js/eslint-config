[eqeqeq](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/eqeqeq)
==============================================
> The reason for this is that == and != do type coercion which follows the rather obscure Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm.
> For instance, the following statements are all considered true:
> + `[] == false`
> + `[] == ![]`
> + `3 == "03"`

â€” [The eslint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/eqeqeq), all said.
